# Signature_Classification
Developed an advanced predictive model that effectively categorizes signatures into their corresponding human classes, showcasing expertise in precise classification methodologies.
Transfer learning is applied by leveraging pre-trained convolutional neural networks (CNNs) such as Xception and VGG16. These models were compared to assess their performance in signature classification. Xception emerged as the top-performing architecture, achieving an outstanding accuracy of 99%.

#Dataset

We utilized signature datasets from 4 individuals, divided into training and testing sets with a 70:30 ratio. This means 70% of the data was used for training the model, while the remaining 30% was reserved for testing and validation purposes.
